                            config is dropped.

                            In the future, all stuff update would

[TODO]

    o Needs let TOC of the article show sect2 page info![High]
        (solution: there are toc-depth(note - there're TWO place for them:
          554 (define (toc-depth nd)
          555   (if (string=? (gi nd) (normalize "book"))
          556       3
          557       (if (string=? (gi nd) (normalize "appendix"))
          558         0
          559         1)))

          -change 559's `1' to `2' to verify if it works or not

    o Needs re-arrange the long table RIL msg display to itemizedlist.[Medium]
